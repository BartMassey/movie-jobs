# Movie Jobs
Copyright (c) 2018 Bart Massey

This Python 3 code supports playing with the "Movie Jobs"
problem as described in Skiena, *Algorithm Design Manual*
[2nd ed], Chapter 1.

This is just a few key functions and some pseudocode, so
the rest is up to you.

* `pseudocode.txt` is pseudocode for a full solution.

* `subsets.py` generates all subsets of a given set.

* `geninst.py` generates a random movie job instance of a
  given size. It includes a command-line driver to
  emit such an instance of size given on the command line.

* `showinst.py` displays an instance and solution given on
  the command line using Turtle Graphics.
